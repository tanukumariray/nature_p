       <center><p><b>Every person on earth needs water to survive. Without it, many of us would get sick and even result in death. While almost 70% of the Earth is made up of water, many parts of the world suffer from clean water shortage. Conserving water is important because it keeps water pure and clean while protecting the environment. It reduces the energy required to process and deliver water, which helps in reducing pollution and in conserving fuel resources. Saving water now means having water available in the future for recreational purposes, too.</b></p></center>
